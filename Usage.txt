How to setup the detector program:

1. Make sure it's in a folder of it's own, and you can access it whenever you'd like.
2. Find this icon and click on it ( http://prntscr.com/p328nu )
3. Type cmd and press enter
( At this point a new window should open )
4. In the command prompt (the window that opened) type `Detector.exe` and press enter.
( You might need to allow windows access to run the file. )

If you did everything correctly, 2 new text files should appear named bad(.txt) and lyrics(.txt)

Usage of the program:

1. Open the lyrics text file
2. Type / Paste the lyrics you want to filter for bad words.
3. Save the text file, and run `Detector.exe` in the command prompt again.

The results will say if the song should be removed for inappropriate words, and it will include the words.
